        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>¾ cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 French baguette</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined. Shape mixture into 12 meatballs, and place in a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While the meatballs are cooking, cut baguette in half lengthwise and open like a book. Remove and discard some of the bread from the inside to make a well for the meatballs.</li>
            <li>Brush baguette with olive oil and season with garlic powder and salt. Place baguette on a baking tray, open and with the oiled sides facing up.</li>
            <li>When the meatballs have 5 minutes left, slip the baguette into the oven and cook until lightly toasted.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, warm spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Remove meatballs from the oven. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the hot sauce; mix gently to coat with sauce.</li>
            <li>Spoon meatballs and sauce into one side of the baguette, nestling meatballs in the well. Top with slices of provolone cheese.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool slightly, then cut into 4 sandwiches.</li>
        </ol>
